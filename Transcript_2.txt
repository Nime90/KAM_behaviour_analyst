Call: Sjoerd Dippenaar (KAM) with BorkaFitness (coach)
Sjoerd: Hi Borka! It’s great to connect again. How are you feeling about this past month? Any standout moments or challenges?
Borka: Hey Sjoerd. Honestly, I’m feeling a bit frustrated. The tools and features in the Lenus app have been a struggle to use effectively. My clients are also finding it difficult to navigate, which makes retention and engagement harder.
Sjoerd: Oh, okay. Let’s take a look at your numbers. I pulled the latest data, and here’s what I see: last month, we aimed for 40 new clients, 12% Instagram engagement growth, and 90% retention. You managed 38 new clients, a 14% engagement boost, but retention came in at 75%. That’s concerning, as retention is a key metric for long-term success. Let’s unpack what’s going wrong here.
Borka: Those numbers are a bit worrying, especially the retention rate. The retention challenges are directly tied to frustrations with the app. My clients and I are still struggling with it.
Sjoerd: Hmm, 38 is still good. And hey, 14% engagement—that’s impressive! As for the app… it’s a solid tool when used right. Maybe you need to spend more time getting familiar with it?
Borka: I’ve already put in time. The weight milestone feature, for instance, doesn’t align with my coaching style, and my clients have expressed frustration with its lack of flexibility.
Sjoerd: Well, honestly, that’s just something we’ll have to work around. Let’s tweak your outreach strategy instead. Your "10-minute morning workouts" post performed great, so why not create more posts like that?
Borka: Sjoerd, I’m looking for more than just social media fixes here. These app issues are impacting my client relationships.
Sjoerd: Okay, but if we keep focusing on what works, like Instagram, you’ll mitigate those retention concerns. For next month, let’s target 42 new clients and keep engagement at 14%. Sound good?
Borka: Sure, but I’d appreciate actionable support on the app too.
Sjoerd: Alright. Two quick action items for you: create two posts with actionable fitness tips, and prioritize warm lead follow-ups. I’ll… check on what the tech team can do, but no promises.
Borka: That’s disappointing. It feels like these concerns are being sidelined.
Sjoerd: Well, I can’t control everything, Borka. Let’s focus on what we can control, like your outreach and social media content. Have you tried incorporating milestone updates into your Instagram stories?
Borka: Not yet, but again, if the app doesn’t work well, those updates are harder to track.
Sjoerd: Okay, fine. Let’s just park the app issues for now. I’ll send over some best practices for outreach and connect you with marketing to optimize your campaigns. Happy?
Borka: Sure, I’ll make it work. Thanks.
Sjoerd: Great. So, to recap: you’ll create two Instagram posts, follow up with leads, and… well, keep working with the tools you have. I’ll try to nudge the tech team. Let’s talk again next month.
Borka: Sounds good. Thanks, Sjoerd.
Sjoerd: Bye, Borka.
