KAM: [Flat tone] Alright, let's get started. I reviewed your account, and frankly, it's pretty unimpressive. What exactly are you expecting from us at this point?

Coach: Well, I wanted to discuss expanding our partnership and see if we could add some new features to better support my fitness clients.

KAM: [Scoffs] Features? You’re barely using the ones you already have. Why should we waste time or resources giving you more?

Coach: I don't think it's a waste. My client base has been growing steadily, and I believe new features could enhance user engagement.

KAM: [Interrupts] “Steadily” is a bit of a stretch, don't you think? Your numbers are mediocre at best. I mean, real growth looks a lot different than what you’re showing us.

Coach: I think you’re misunderstanding the value my business offers. My clients are loyal, and my retention rate is high.

KAM: Look, loyalty is nice and all, but it doesn’t move the needle. We care about volume, not your feel-good stats. And let’s be honest, you’re not exactly a major player in this market.

Coach: [Frustrated] I’ve been working hard to build this business, and dismissing it like that is uncalled for. I need a partner who respects my efforts.

KAM: [Sarcastic] Respect? This isn’t about respect; it’s about results. If you want a hand-holding session, maybe you should reconsider what industry you're in.

Coach: This attitude is really unprofessional. I expected more support from your company.

KAM: Well, expectations don’t always match reality. We can’t prioritize every small-timer who walks through the door. Are we done here?
